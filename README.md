# CS61C-summer20

This is my code for studying [CS61C-summer20](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61c/su20/).

---

At this moment, I have already studied the whole course. However, in my own
opinion, if you self-study this course, you shouldn't be devoted into the
project 4 and project 3 part b for TOO MUCH time.

For project 4, the `dumbpy` package cannot be accessed, which should be a big trouble,
so I recommend you to learn [CS149](https://gfxcourses.stanford.edu/cs149/fall21/lecture/),
which talks about the parallel computing, I think it is much better due to the UNIX
principle: do one thing and do it well.

For project 3 part b, the reason why I don't recommend is that it is tedious, it's so boring
to design a control unit by hard-wired way unless you use some hardware language to simplify
the process, so I think the most important thing to learn is project 3 part a, it's enough for you
to understand how CPU works.

At last, thanks for CS61C team, although I have already learned some basic ideas, it is CS61C that
makes work in action, and enhance my understanding about the architecture.
